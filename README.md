# php-skeleton-library
A PHP skeleton project with some goodies.

### Testing

The composer.json comes with [PHPUnit]() and the task runner [Robo](https://github.com/consolidation/Robo).

To execute the task runner defined in the `RoboFile`:
```
$ composer test
```

The robo plugin executes the tests **every time a change is made in src or tests folder**. You can tweak this to your preference in the RoboFile.
